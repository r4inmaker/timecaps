# Unofficial Implementation of the Paper TimeCaps: Capturing Time Series Data With Capsule Networks

We implemented the idea from the 2022 paper [TimeCaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11800), trained the model
on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset and got the proof of concept by getting comparable results.
Aim of this repository is to extend this idea and transfer it to time series data of other domains to solve
classification problems and maybe even find a use case for reconstructions.
